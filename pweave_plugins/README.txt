To enable the functionality of the plugins (.py files) in this directory, they
can be copied to a "pweave_plugins" subfolder of the folder containing the
pweave source file, or to the ~/.pweave_plugins folder.

HOT TIP: make a ~/.pweave_plugins symbolic link to this folder, to
automatically have all the latest plugins at your fingertips by just updating
your mercurial repository.
